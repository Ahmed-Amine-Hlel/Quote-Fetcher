# Quote Fetcher

This project is a simple web application that fetches random quotes from an API and displays them to the user. The user can then generate a new quote at the click of a button.

The purpose of this project was to experiment with webpack 5, SASS, and API calls in JavaScript. It serves as a great introduction to how these technologies can be used together to build a dynamic web application.
